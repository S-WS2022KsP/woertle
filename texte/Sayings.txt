Im Überlandtaxi durch die kubanische Provinz, noch eine Stunde bis Havanna. Der Fahrer erzählt von dem Esel, der ihm kürzlich vors Auto lief, "dummer Esel". Wie er so redet, überfährt er ein Schwein. Ein wildes Ferkel, es kam aus dem Gebüsch. "Dummes Schwein", sagt der Fahrer und hält.

Er fährt den Kilometer ins nächste Dorf und brüllt etwas von einem toten Ferkel aus dem Fenster. Die Leute vor den Bretterhütten lassen Schaufel und Baseballschläger fallen, rennen los Richtung Schwein. Nur einer rennt weg, hinter einen Schuppen.

Nach ein paar Sekunden ist er wieder da - auf einem Fahrrad. Nicht dumm.
